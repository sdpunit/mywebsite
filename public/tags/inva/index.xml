      <description>&lt;p&gt;As someone who likes to explore and learn a range of things, I have been to several talks and workshop, but I am not going to list all of them here, rather I will share in the order of how deep impact some of those had on me and something that I learnt from each of them&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;microsoft-student-accelerator-2023&#34;&gt;Microsoft Student Accelerator 2023&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having been to this bi-yearly meetup many times, not only did I become good friends with some of the employees (love to Tracey and Aimn) and had a great time meeting them every time I went back but I was particular striken from one of the talks by Aaron Dinnage (for my reference) from Microsoft Canberra Team at that time - two things that struck me the most&lt;/p&gt;</description>
