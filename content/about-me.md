## This page is for knowing me as a human 

### In my free time, here's what I like doing:
- Spending time with my friends.
- Playing chess (I’m not the best, but I’m addicted to it).
- Playing badminton (definitely something I like doing, and I’m good at it).
- Scrolling through Reddit/X – my feed is mostly about machine learning and AI. On X, it's purely American politics.
- Insane obsession with American politics (’cause it's bizarre and very happening) – I’m curious to see everything in the world from their lens.

### Random Things That I Love:
- Apple (the iPhone company)
- Colognes – can never seem to find the right one, but I have an unusual collection.
- *(This line was left blank – feel free to add another item or delete this bullet)*

### Podcasts I Listen To:
- *The Five* – grown fond of this person called Jessica Tarlov.
- *Risky.Biz* – Australian cybersecurity hosts, fantastic podcast to keep up with cybersecurity trends and companies.
- *Raging Moderates* – again, only because of Jessica Tarlov.
- *BG2Pod* – These *(consider completing this sentence for clarity)*

### Quotes That Inspired Me:

All of them were sent by my mom (my role model) – who knows exactly the right thing to say/send at the right time. [Check this page](http://localhost:1313/quotes/).
