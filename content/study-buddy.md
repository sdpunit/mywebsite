## About

The *Study Buddy* app — was built as part of a group project for my software construction course. The idea was simple: help users stay focused by limiting distractions and structuring their study time better. The motivation came from our shared struggle with staying productive for long stretches, especially while working from home or studying alone.

It was built using Java and Android studio, and our team took an agile approach, with regular check-ins, planning sessions, and a lot of trial and error.

## The Process


I took the lead on some of the front-end logic and also helped troubleshoot state management issues when our timer wasn’t syncing correctly. We also had to learn how to use Git properly as a team — which, let’s just say, led to a few merge conflicts and some accidental overwrites.

But what really stood out was how much smoother things got once we started setting small, achievable goals for each sprint and actually stuck to them. Weekly standups helped us identify blockers quickly, and our retrospectives helped us improve as a team.

## Result

The app turned out to be simple but clean. It had features like timed focus sessions, a break reminder, and a task tracker. We even included a small leaderboard as a stretch goal to keep users motivated.
