Some quotes that stuck with me.

This quote always brings a smile to my face. It gives people hope to keep going and never give up.

> **Everything will be okay in the end. If it's not okay, it's not the end.**

Another one of my favourites â€” especially when I find myself in certain situations. These are the moments when emotions can take over, and you might say or do something you'll regret later.

> **Never reply** when you are angry.  
> **Never make a promise** when you are happy.  
> **Never make a decision** when you are sad.

So take some time. Once you're out of that moment, rethink how best to respond to the situation.

> **You don't learn, then start. You start, then learn.**
