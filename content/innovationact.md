## My experience

It was fantastic to be part of the Innovationact program. I learned a lot about entrepreneurship and innovation, and I had the opportunity to work with some amazing people. The program was well-structured and provided a great balance of theory and practical experience. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in starting their own business or working in the innovation space.

## What I learned
1. **The importance of a strong team**: A successful startup is built on the foundation of a strong team. I learned that having a diverse group of people with different skills and perspectives can lead to better decision-making and problem-solving.


2. **The value of customer feedback**: I learned that getting feedback from customers early and often is crucial to building a successful product. It helps you understand what your customers want and need, and allows you to iterate and improve your product based on their feedback.
