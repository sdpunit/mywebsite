## About

The Student Research Conference (SRC) is ANU’s annual event for students across disciplines to showcase their research — whether it’s a major thesis project, a summer internship, or a topic you’re just deeply curious about. It’s a week-long mix of presentations, posters, workshops, and keynotes that brings together researchers from all levels and backgrounds.



## My Role

I was part of the engagement team and also had the chance to MC the conference — which meant welcoming speakers, keeping sessions on time, and basically making sure things flowed smoothly from the stage. It was my first proper public speaking gig since high school, and it came with all the nerves, excitement, and adrenaline you'd expect.

Also worth noting — this was during a week filled with other commitments, so I was juggling a lot. But it taught me how to keep my energy up, stay composed under pressure, and speak clearly even when my brain was half thinking about three other tasks.

## Takeaways

### You might be stressing more than people even care

MC-ing the SRC — in front of a pretty packed hall — was one of my first major public speaking moments since high school. And naturally, I was nervous. Obsessing over how I’d sound, whether I’d stumble on a word, and if people would notice I was anxious.

But one big thing I learnt: most people are too focused on their own stuff to care about the tiny things you’re stressing over. Once I accepted that, it was easier to just enjoy the moment. I realised I could be present and still do a great job, even if it wasn’t “perfect.”
