### Creating Content

Here I’m referring specifically to creating posters — and having made countless of them by now, I’ve developed a pretty good sense of how to market events to a student audience.

In summary:

1. **Make the event details clear.** As tempting as it is to make something look beautiful, it can end up overcomplicating things and completely miss the point of the poster (or online post) in the first place.  

2. **Use clear bullet points**, whenever possible. These three questions work best:
   - What?
   - When?
   - Where?

Once you have that locked in, you can build all the creativity you want around it. But the core info should never be hard to find.

### Debrief

We made it a habit to constantly debrief as a team — figuring out what worked and what didn’t. This helped us reflect on our approach and improve it consistently.

When we didn’t get the engagement we were hoping for, we went back to the start. We asked: *What are we missing?* and *What is the actual goal of this event or message?* Taking a step back allowed us to come up with some genuinely creative and effective ideas.

**One example** — we noticed a high proportion of residents were from China. So we trialed a bilingual poster: English and Chinese, side by side. We pinned it up around the building, and immediately saw a big improvement in turnout for the event.

That experience really confirmed something for us: **team reflection is crucial**. It’s not just about running the event, but about asking ourselves *why* we’re doing something and *who* we’re doing it for.
