With the group of wonderful people in the photo above, I hit the road for a week-long trip, visiting schools across rural NSW.  
Before anything else, I want to acknowledge and give full credit to Jae and Imogen for setting up this brilliant program.

## About

This was part of a non-profit career outreach initiative, where we visited schools in remote and regional parts of New South Wales to help students learn more about university, career pathways, and life after school. We delivered workshops, had open conversations, and shared personal stories to help bridge the gap between rural education and higher education opportunities.

## Purpose

We weren’t there to preach or sell anything. Just to be share experiences and give students the space to ask real questions about careers, study, city life, and everything in between.

## Team in Action

This was a true team effort. We came from different backgrounds, with different experiences and stories — but that’s exactly what made the group dynamic so valuable. Everyone brought something unique to the table, and we learnt just as much from each other as the students learnt from us.

Whether it was helping each other prep for sessions, navigating late-night debriefs, or making sure the energy stayed high despite the long drives — the team made this experience what it was.
