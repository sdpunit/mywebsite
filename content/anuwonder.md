## ANU Wonder Program

ANU Wonder is a program that supports people from underrepresented backgrounds in accessing education after school.

We work across the ACT and NSW with young people – in both primary and high schools – as well as with mature-age students. ANU Wonder provides guidance, helps individuals explore their interests and strengths, and supports them in taking the steps needed to turn their aspirations into reality. We visit schools and run activities there, and we also welcome people onto the ANU campus. Our team includes fantastic ANU Student Leaders who generously share their own experiences.

As part of the Regional Partnerships Project Pool Program (RPPPP), ANU Wonder collaborates with Regional Study Hubs to co-design and deliver community-specific sub-projects that promote local access to education.

This role taught me a lot about myself – more than I expected.  
One of the biggest lessons I’ve learnt is that it’s okay to be quiet when I don’t have anything to say. I’ve started embracing silence, something the old me would’ve felt really uncomfortable with. Now, I feel more relaxed, I don’t blurt things I might regret later, and I’ve learnt to respect my own boundaries.

## My Role

- **Facilitating workshops** – running activities during school visits.  
- **Connecting with students** – having conversations, learning about their passions and interests, and sharing my own experiences to help them make informed decisions about their future.  
- **Designing activities** – creating sessions tailored to different cohorts and specific communities.  
- **Building surveys and databases** – to help us make more data-driven decisions.

## Thoughts After

1. **The importance of a meeting facilitator:**  
During one of our debriefs, things got tense. People started reacting to each other rather than addressing the actual issues. Emotions took over, and the conversation became unproductive.  
What I took from that – every meeting needs a facilitator. Someone who keeps the discussion on track, sets boundaries, ensures everyone’s heard, and reminds the group of the goals. It makes all the difference.
