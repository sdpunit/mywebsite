## ANU Wonder Program
ANU Wonder is a program that works with people from underrepresented backgrounds to access education after school.

We work around the ACT and NSW with young people, in primary and high schools, and with mature age students too! ANU Wonder provides information, helps people consider interests and strengths, and supports the steps to make aspirations real. We visit schools and run activities there, and we welcome people onto the ANU campus too. Our team includes excellent ANU Student Leaders who share their own experiences.

Within the Regional Partnerships Project Pool Program (RPPPP), ANU Wonder partners with Regional Study Hubs to collaborate in the creation and delivery of community specific sub-projects for local educational access promotion.
