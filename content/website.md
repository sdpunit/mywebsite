While I *should* be studying for my semesters, I was building this instead.

## Surprises

This journey came with more than a few unexpected surprises. But what are surprises, if not learning lessons? Here are some of the things I encountered — and what I learnt along the way:

### Learning Never Stops

> You don't learn, then start. You start, and then learn.

I thought this would be a quick and easy project. Setting things up seemed like the hardest part. But once that was done, new problems kept popping up.

For example — after publishing the site, I couldn’t get the tags to work. Turns out, it was because of how the pages were being redirected. That was just one of many rabbit holes I didn’t expect to fall into.

### Journal Everything

> You learn more about yourself when you journal.

Sounds cliché and... ugh — but when I started recalling and writing about past experiences, it helped me see the moments that really mattered to me and stood out.  

It also showed me how much I’ve grown.

**Moral of the story**: document everything.
