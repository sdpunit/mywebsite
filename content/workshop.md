I grew up in a household where my dad would always say: never hesitate to invest in your brain. He’d encourage me to attend as many talks and conferences as possible — even if it meant spending money to be part of them.

I definitely took the first part to heart. As for the second part… not quite there yet. I usually try to find student discounts or volunteer at events to skip the "spending money" part of that sentence.

Over the years, I’ve been to several talks and workshops. Instead of listing each one, I want to share a few that had the deepest impact on me — and one thing I took away from each.

## Microsoft Student Accelerator 2023

I’ve attended this bi-yearly meetup several times. Over time, I became friends with some of the Microsoft Canberra employees (shoutout to Tracey and Aimn!) and looked forward to seeing them every time I went back.

But one particular talk — by Aaron Dinnage (for my reference) — really stood out. Two things he said have stuck with me ever since:

*(And for all the recruiters reading this — these are strictly **his** words, not mine, in case you don’t like the approach!)*

### 1. Take charge of the interview

> “Take charge of the interview — switch the roles. Ask the interviewer how their day was. Just like they’re trying to get to know you, you need to understand them too. And by the end, the interviewer will be left wondering at what point the roles reversed.  
> And don’t be nervous — most interviewers are just as nervous as you.”

He shared how, in training team members to conduct interviews for the first time, many of them were visibly nervous and unsure of themselves. That gave me a completely new perspective — interviewers are also human, also figuring things out, also trying to do a good job.

Thinking from their side of the table helped change how I walk into interviews. I carry that confidence with me now, and I always want to remember this before going into any interview.

### 2. Be a multi-dimensional person

> “Don’t be a 1-D person. Be a multi-dimensional person. Try to explore different fields, learn as much as you can, and have an opinion on everything.”

The line *“have an opinion on everything”* really stuck with me. I loved it.  

Since then, I’ve tried to live by it. If someone brings up something I don’t know much about, I make it a point to look into it later. I try to understand the different perspectives around it — what I conclude tells me something about my values and who I am.  

There were a lot of great takeaways from the event, but these two resonated with me the most — and stayed with me.

### 1. Follow the 80-20 rule

> “If you’re talking to a customer and getting feedback, you should only be talking 20% of the time. The other 80% should be the person you're trying to get insights from. Otherwise, you take over the meeting — and you’ll leave without learning much.”

I liked this rule because it applies to way more than just customer feedback. It’s about listening. In any conversation, you’ll always get more out of it when you actually listen and give your full attention.

It reminded me that listening is a skill — not just about staying quiet, but about being present.

## Microsoft Student Accelerator 2023
Having been to this bi-yearly meetup many times, not only did I become good friends with some of the employees (love to Tracey and Aimn) and had a great time meeting them every time I went back but I was particular striken from one of the talks by Aaron Dinnage (for my reference) from Microsoft Canberra Team at that time - two things that struck me the most

-- (and for all the Recruiters who might be reading this - these are strictly his words not mine! in case you don't like this approach)
1.
> Take charge of the interview, switch the roles - ask them how there day was just as much as the interviewer is trying to know, you need to understand them as well and by the end the interviewer would be left wondering at what stage you swapped roles. And don't be nervous - most of the interviewers are just as nervous as you. 

He shared his experience about training people in the team to be interviewers for the first time, and how nervous they get during the questions, and they are trying their best to ask the right questions. Listening to this made me realise, how much this information helps knowing what the other side is feeling. 

If an individual has been in an hiring process themselves, it's easier for them to be able to sit and watch from the other side of the shoe and learn what HR is looking for and understand their side. And to be able to think about this experience from the other side, changed my point of view of how I went into interviews. 

I was inspired by that sense of confidence that a person should have when walking into an interview. This is something I always want to remember whenever walking in the interview. 

2. 
I really liked the way he put it and it end up becoming the second thing that struck me the most and I took away from the event
> Don't a 1-D person, be a multi dimensional person. Try to explore different fields, try to learn as much as you can, and have an opinion on everything. 

"Have an opinion on everything" I really loved that, and since then they stuck in my mind and heart and I learnt to live by them. If somebody brings up something that you don't know much about, try to learn more about it, do your own research, learn about all the facets of the issue and what you end up concluding tells your values and defines you as an individual. 

Well there were a lot of things but these two resonated and stuck with me the most.

### 1. Follow 80-20 rule
If you are talking to a customer and getting feedback, you should only be talking 20% of time, rest 80% should be the other person that are trying to get feedback from. Otherwise, you take over meeting, and you will be come back not getting much out of it. 

I liked this rule, because this applies in a diverse range of situation. When people talk about listening skills - you should not be the one talking. You will get more out of any coversation when you listen properly and give your attention.  -->
